## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this body mass index calculator page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Expected behaviour

Below you will find the BMI ranges and their weight classifications. Based on the person's BMI results, add their weight classification to the sentence "Your BMI suggests youâ€™re" within the results component.

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Healthy weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25 to 29.9
- Obese: BMI 30 or greater

Add the individual's healthy weight range based on the lower and upper BMI categorisations and the person's height.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide Figma version of the design.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

There are many ways to host your project for free.

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
